            <p><strong>“VASUDHAIVA KUTUMBAKAM”</strong> is a Sanskrit phrase that translates to “THE WORLD IS ONE FAMILY”</p>
            <p>It’s an ancient Indian concept that promotes the idea of the entire world as a single interconnected family, where people from all walks of life and backgrounds are considered part of the same global.</p>
            <p>This principle emphasizes unity, peace, and the understanding that all humans share a common bond.</p>
            <p>In INDIA, we believe in <strong>“ATITHI DEVO BHAVA”</strong> which means “THE GUEST IS GOD”.</p>
            <p>So you have to come and visit INDIA to experience this and make INDIA your “SECOND HOME”.</p>
